# ![File Management Cli App in Rust]

##[Demo]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Cli App in Rust]

This codebase is intended to showcase a cli application, built entirely in Rust programming language, with the functionalities of file creation and editing. This application is cross-platform and I've intended it to showcase the power of native solution that works across multiple platforms that allows you to run a binary/or allows a cli terminal.

## How it works

You can pull this code base and simply

- Install [Rust]

```cli
Cargo build --release
```

```cli
rust_garden_cli write
```
